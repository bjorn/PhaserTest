A simple project to demonstrate Tiled maps running on Phaser, a HTML5 game framework.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* typescript
* http-server

### Installing

Assuming you have cloned the project and had the prerequisites installed globally, go to the project root and run the following commands:

```

In your web browser, go to `http:\\localhost:8080`, to check that the web server is running the game locally.
